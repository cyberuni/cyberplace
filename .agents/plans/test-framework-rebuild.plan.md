# CR: test-framework rebuild — two-axis test doctrine

## Resolved decisions (do not relitigate — see also commit 77fd05a8)

- **Axis 1** — a suite specifies **acceptance** only, STRICT: the capability's **decision graph**
  (one scenario per edge; guard/negative edge paired with a positive companion; each edge isolates a
  specific condition). Invariants/co-owned seams are out of scope.
- **Axis 2** — verification **level** (e2e>…>unit) is a test impl detail: **as high as it doesn't
  hurt** (pyramid; boundary the honest substitute where e2e is infeasible). Lives on the impl bars.
- **`@pinned`** — user-owned seed scenario; agent proposes, never executes change/removal without
  in-session user authorization; grounded in ownership (not freeze); a pin seeds graph growth.
- **Node model** — `## What` / `## Use Cases` (each named to its impl surface — CLI verb / function /
  endpoint) / `## Logic` (shared decision graph) / `## Scenario map` (grouped by use case) / optional
  `## References` last.
  **Amended after the pilot (see `spec-organization-rebuild.plan.md`):**
  - the map unit is a **(path class, edge)** pair, not an edge — `Given` = path, `When` = edge. The
    map is 1:1 **scenario<->row** and gains a **`Path`** column; one edge may carry several rows
    (permutation coverage). Duplicate = same edge **and** same path class.
  - **reconverged paths collapse** where the outcome does not differ; an over-specific `Given`
    manufactures a false permutation.
  - the invariant-cut heuristic is **retired** — the filter is "can you name the edge"; a constraint
    holding across every path is the **convergence** shape, not an invariant.
  - a `Given` must be a **scaffoldable state** (observable not evaluative, present not absent, one
    condition per step).
  - `## References` (optional, any spec-type) cites research backing a decision.
  - **Open:** "each use case named to its impl surface" does not fit a procedural skill, whose
    surface is one invocation; the pilot named them by entry condition instead.
- **Actors judge the PROJECT** (capability), not the document's prose (that's spec/suite-format).
- **Vocabulary** — "suite" = scenarios-as-behavior; "`.feature`" = the file/format only.
- **workflows/** (was acceptance/) — project-level workflow suite; a workflow is the project-level
  analog of a use case (a path through the composed capabilities); the capability map is the
  project's logic graph. `ledger/` is a fourth folder kind (provenance data, not a spec node).
- **Rename: COMPLETE (not revert)** — owner-decided 2026-07-18. Finish the facet label
  `'e2e'` -> `'workflow'`, the 2 frozen re-cuts, and the `.feature` comment sweep.
- **Actor-bar reframe: propagate to ALL THREE** — owner-decided 2026-07-18. `oracle-spec`,
  `builder-spec`, `architect-impl` join `architect-spec` on project-framing + two-kinds duplication.

## Clearance — recorded owner ratification (2026-07-18)

Owner ratified re-cutting two frozen scenarios as part of completing the `acceptance/` ->
`workflows/` rename (a narrowing that realigns the frozen contract with landed code):

- `concept-index.feature` — "acceptance/ node annotated as e2e" (~lines 33-44) -> `workflows/`
  node annotated as `workflow`.
- `scaffold-project-spec.feature` (`:78`) — scaffolds `design/, acceptance/, …` -> `workflows/`.

Basis: the rename already landed in `concept-index.mts` (`workflows/` path match, commit
`4a38a937`); these two frozen scenarios are the last sites still asserting the pre-rename
vocabulary, so they diverge from live behavior. No behavior is being widened.

## NEXT — resume here

**Next action:** todo 7 — **engines**: the scenario-map coverage lint in `check-suite`, then the
confirm-read engine + wiring into the 5 roles. Both blocking decisions are RESOLVED and executed
(`86082a1e` record, `5bf88bfa` rename, `d753e189` actor bars); `pnpm verify` GREEN 34/34.

**Then:** ssa-lowering #304/#305/#306 (all Clearance — needs the same grant->record->edit flow used
for the rename re-cuts) -> corpus sweep -> spec gate + handoff.

**How a Clearance clears the align-spec engine (learned this session):** `align-spec.mts` diffs
scenarios against `DEFAULT_BASE = 'HEAD'`, so a ratified re-cut shows as a drift FAIL until it is
committed — committing after the recorded ratification IS the clearance step, not a suppression.
Do not chase it as a regression.

**Findings the diff won't show:**
- The `.md`-only blast estimate MISSED the rename's code + frozen-suite dependency; the propagation
  subagent (Sonnet) caught it and deliberately left doctrine-term "acceptance" (acceptance
  boundary/level) untouched — that belongs to the corpus sweep, not the rename.
- The frozen-contract divergence flagged at the last checkpoint is now RESOLVED by the two ratified
  re-cuts. Worth keeping: the facet-label change silently staled the generated by-concept block in
  `sdd/spec.md`, which surfaced only as a downstream `align-spec` FAIL — regenerate the index
  (`concept-index.mts --write --spec-dir`) whenever a facet label or folder name moves.
- Doctrine-term "acceptance" still stands corpus-wide (prose about the acceptance *level*), by
  design. That is todo 9's corpus sweep, and it must NOT be treated as leftover rename debt.

**Remaining CR work after the two decisions:** engines (scenario-map lint, confirm-read) -> ssa-lowering
#304/#305/#306 (Clearance) -> corpus sweep -> spec gate + handoff.
