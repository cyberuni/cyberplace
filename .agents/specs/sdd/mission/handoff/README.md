# mission/handoff/ — the handoff phase (step 4)

The **handoff phase** of the Mission Loop — step 4. Take step-3's verified result (from
`../delivery.md`) and land it in the **project-declared delivery shape**. `handoff` is a verb,
like the other mission phases; the **outcome** is the noun this action produces (a set of
commits, a PR, a published chapter). The orchestrator that sequences this phase is
`../README.md` (the [`conductor`](../conductor/README.md) unit).

> **This is a single behavioral unit, not an overview** — handoff has no sub-skills; the behavior
> is enacted by the conductor (the [`conductor`](../conductor/README.md) realization, built in
> `core-agents`). This spec owns the **behavior + suite** ([`handoff.feature`](./handoff.feature)).

## Use Cases

**Subject** — the handoff phase: landing a verified result in the project's declared delivery
shape, decomposed by unit of work, then writing the CR's public conclusion back to its source.

**Non-goals** — it does **not** re-verify (it consumes the verified result), does **not** touch the
contract **content** or write spec/suite frontmatter (it may **relocate** a node — a pure rename that
preserves freeze — but never edits a scenario or a frontmatter field), introduces **no** new hard
floor, and does **not** retire the mission plan (the doctrine loop deletes it later). The impl-gate
verdict that produced the verified result is the [`conductor`](../conductor/README.md) unit's, not
this phase's.

Every scenario in [`handoff.feature`](./handoff.feature) maps to one of these behaviors:

| Behavior | What it covers |
|---|---|
| **finalize placement** | relocate this mission's provisionally-placed nodes to their blessed home via a pure rename (freeze survives), scoped to the touched nodes, logged — in the same change |
| **land in the declared shape** | detect the project's single declared shape and land accordingly (commit-to-main / branch+PR / deploy / chapter) |
| **decompose by unit of work** | a multi-unit cycle lands as multiple commits / a unit-split PR, never one blob, never two unrelated concerns together |
| **conditional status write-back** | when the source closes by reference, handoff writes the auto-close reference (`Closes #N`) into the PR body so the source closes on merge; a non-close-capable source gets none; direct-to-`main` work transitions the source to `done` on push |
| **distilled public summary** | append an outward-facing conclusion + follow-ups (which re-enter as new CRs) to the source — not the combat log |
| **file identified follow-ups** | file one issue per identified follow-up immediately and autonomously — no approval gate — deduping against the forge's open issues first; a source with no issue forge files none |
| **no new floor** | handoff raises no new mandatory escalation; earlier hard floors already fired |
| **the plan is kept, not landed, not retired** | the `.plan.md` stays in the PR as scratch, is not landed as a delivery artifact, and is not retired early |
| **nudge the formation loop** | surface a reminder after landing that a corpus-wide formation pass is due (via `sdd:manage`) — spawn nothing, gate nothing |

## Inputs

The verified result of the deliver phase: the implementation passed the impl gate, impl-sync holds
(the frozen suite runs green), and the colocated unit suites plus `../../acceptance/` are green.
Handoff **consumes** this; it does not re-verify and it does not touch the contract.

## Placement finalization — the scoped Warden pass

Before landing, handoff finalizes **where** the mission's nodes live. Explore placed each new node in
a *provisional* home (`../../design/spec-layout.md`); now that the work is built and verified — the
moment of best information — handoff runs a Warden placement pass **scoped to the mission's touched
nodes**, applies the placement-map routing table (`../../design/spec-layout.md`), and **relocates** any
misplaced node to its blessed home via `git mv`, in the **same change** so the delivery shows every
node already in the right place — no follow-up formation CR.

- **A relocation is a pure rename, never a content edit.** A frozen `.feature` stays frozen across the
  move (`../../design/lifecycle-model.md`, freeze-protects-content-not-path); the move touches the
  spec/suite node only — never the impl — so the impl-gate verdict is path-independent, and squad
  resolution (by `artifact-types`, not folder) is unchanged.
- **Scoped, not corpus-wide.** This finalizes only *this mission's* placement; cross-mission structural
  drift (node-shape audit + align across missions) is the **separate** corpus-wide formation loop
  (`../../formation/`), not this pass.
- **Logged, keyed by name.** Each relocation is recorded as a detail-adjustment in the combat log
  (`../../design/provenance-model.md`), referencing the node by its **stable name**, so the move never
  dangles a reference.
- **Usually a no-op.** With the routing table + `place-node` (`../../project-spec/`), explore's provisional
  pick is usually already the blessed home, so most missions relocate nothing.

**Nudging the corpus-wide pass.** After landing (below), handoff **does not spawn** the Warden. It
**surfaces a one-line reminder** that a corpus-wide formation pass is due, pointing to `sdd:manage`
("audit the corpus structure" → `formation-loop`). The pass is **on-demand**, run deliberately when
someone chooses — a full corpus scan on every mission landing is costly and noisy, and `sdd:manage`
already owns the on-demand trigger. Handoff gates nothing on it and reads back nothing; the loop's
own behavior (what the pass does once running) is owned entirely by `../../formation/`. The
formation loop's documented "post-mission" cadence is unchanged — only its trigger moves from an
auto-spawn to this nudge.

## The delivery-shape contract

The **delivery shape** is a property the **project declares once** — it is part of the
project's harness, not a per-CR choice. The shape names how a verified result becomes a
durable outcome for *this kind of project*. SDD does not assume one shape; it detects the
project's declared shape and lands the result accordingly.

| Project kind | Declared delivery shape | Outcome (the noun) |
|---|---|---|
| repo / package (commit-to-main) | commits broken down by unit of work, committed to `main` | a sequence of commits on `main` |
| repo / package (PR flow) | a branch pushed, opened as a pull request | a branch + PR |
| website / app | a deploy of the verified build | a released site/app version |
| article / book | a written chapter or section landed in the manuscript | a published chapter |

The set is **open** — a project can declare another shape — but a project has exactly one
declared shape, so handoff is deterministic at run time.

## The unit of delivery

Delivery is decomposed by **unit of work** — one coherent, independently revertable change —
the same granularity the repo's commit discipline already enforces. A multi-unit cycle lands
as multiple commits (or a PR whose commits are split by unit), never as one undifferentiated
blob and never two unrelated concerns together. This keeps the outcome auditable and
revertable at the same grain the work was reasoned about.

## No handoff-layer hard floor

Handoff introduces **no new mandatory human escalation**. The only hard-floor escalations are
the ones raised earlier in the loop (see `../../design/autonomy-rubric.md`): **Clearance** (a
**narrowing** — weakening or deleting an e2e scenario), **Compatibility** (the change's **semver
class** over the authorized ceiling), and **Conflict resolution** (a logical contradiction inside
the suite). A separate handoff-layer floor for irreversible execution acts (force-push, data loss,
history rewrite) was **considered and rejected** — those are not a gate: SDD work is git-reversible,
and genuinely irreversible acts are out of scope (externally guarded) or pre-authorized
(`../../design/autonomy-rubric.md`). If a narrowing or a breaking change-class is in scope it was
already cleared in step 2/3 before any code was written, so handoff never has to halt mid-flight.

## Provenance

What was delivered, in what shape, broken into which units, lands in the durable **public
trail** — the CR-source conclusion, the changesets, and git history (see
`../../design/provenance-model.md`) — never the combat log (committed but transient, deleted
from the tree at retro). Handoff does not write spec/suite frontmatter; the contract is
already firmed.

### Conclusion write-back to the source

Handoff is where the CR's **public conclusion** is written back to its source (the mechanics
live in `../../intake/README.md`):

- **Status.** Conditional, never bookkeeping: when the source **supports closing by reference**
  (a same-forge issue — GitHub, GitLab), handoff **writes the auto-close reference** (`Closes #N`,
  naming the source) **into the PR body**, so the source auto-closes on merge — SDD adds no
  separate close. A CR with **no close-by-reference source** (a bare prompt, or a cross-system
  source such as Asana/Jira) gets **no closing reference**; work landed **directly on `main`**
  transitions the source to `done` on push, and a cross-system source is moved natively (`../intake/README.md`).
- **Distilled summary.** A short, **public-worthy** conclusion — what shipped, in what shape,
  and any **follow-up tasks** (which re-enter SDD as new CRs) — is appended to the source. This
  is deliberately the *outward* distillate, not the internal combat log: it is part of the
  **public trail** the campaign / formation outer loops read forward via their cursor, so they
  resume from conclusions instead of cold-scanning the product. The summary **cites the
  follow-up issues handoff filed** (below) by reference, rather than restating them as prose.

### Follow-ups are filed, not surfaced

An **identified follow-up** is work the mission noticed but held out of scope. Handoff holds
**standing authority to file it** — it opens one issue per follow-up **immediately and
autonomously, with no approval gate**. An identified follow-up that waits for a gate is lost;
filing is cheap and reversible, so the decision is **file now, close later** rather than drop the
thread. This is a **grant, not a floor**: it removes a wait and adds no escalation, so the
[no-new-floor](#no-handoff-layer-hard-floor) contract is unchanged.

- **Dedupe before filing, never blind.** Handoff **searches the source forge's open issues** for a
  match first. A follow-up matching an existing open issue **files nothing** — that issue already
  stands as the follow-up's record. This is the behavior handoff must exhibit, not a delegation to
  any particular repo's issue-filing tooling.
- **One issue per follow-up.** Distinct follow-ups never merge into one omnibus issue — each
  re-enters SDD as its own CR (`../../intake/README.md`), at the same one-concern grain as the
  [unit of delivery](#the-unit-of-delivery).
- **Forge-conditional.** Filing needs a source forge that supports issues (the same-forge case the
  [status write-back](#conclusion-write-back-to-the-source) already scopes — GitHub, GitLab). A CR
  whose source has **no** issue forge (a bare prompt, or a cross-system source) files **none**; its
  follow-ups stay in the distilled summary only. SDD assumes no specific forge.

### The plan is a portable handoff artifact

The mission **plan** (`.agents/plans/<cr-ref>.plan.md`) is itself a self-contained, portable
brief (`../../design/provenance-model.md`): a different agent or model can pick up an
in-flight mission from it. It is **tracked worktree-local scratch** — committed with the work
and kept in the PR (the decision + failure trail reviewers want), but handoff does **not**
treat it as a delivery artifact to land in the declared shape. The doctrine loop **deletes it
from the tree later** (a tracked deletion, once distilled and the source is done) — handoff
neither retires it early nor specially preserves it.

## Scenarios (colocated)

Unit scenarios for handoff (decompose-by-unit, land in the declared shape, the PR-flow vs
commit-to-main branch, no new floor) **colocate** in this folder. Cross-capability outcomes
that run a CR end-to-end through handoff live in `../../acceptance/`.
