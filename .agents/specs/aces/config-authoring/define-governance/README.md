# define-governance — author a governance

Scaffold a reference-only governance (rubric / constraint-set / checklist / decision-table).

## Use Cases

**Subject** — authoring or improving a reference-only governance file (rubric, constraint set,
checklist, decision table, or mixed) that other skills and agents load on demand, scaffolding its
canonical file and runtime symlinks while enforcing the non-auto-trigger contract.
**Non-goals** — authoring a workflow agent definition that the user triggers (`define-agent`); scoring
a config against its golden set (`run`); adding or fixing eval cases (`add` / `improve`); the
governance-quality rubric itself (that is the quality-check governance the skill loads).

| Use case | Trigger / inputs | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger on a governance request | a request to create/improve a reference-only rule or criteria file, vs. a sibling intent (a workflow agent definition, or an eval-run scoring / case-authoring request) carrying the same config vocabulary | `define-governance` fires for a governance request and defers when the intent belongs to `define-agent` / `run` / `add` |
| Distinguish governance from a workflow skill | content that describes what to enforce (criteria/rules) vs. how to do something (steps) | the content is treated as a governance when it encodes criteria and is redirected to a workflow skill when it encodes action steps |
| Resolve placement and runtimes | scope (user-global / project / plugin) and target runtimes are unclear from context | the canonical path is derived and one symlink is created per selected runtime |
| Select the content type | the user names the primary shape: rubric, constraint set, checklist, decision table, or mixed | the drafted body's section structure matches the chosen content type |
| Scaffold the governance file | a gathered name, topic, consumers, and the rules or criteria | a canonical file is written with the required frontmatter and a body opening with the scope line |
| Enforce the non-auto-trigger contract | a governance must never auto-trigger from user input | the file's description carries the `Internal skill:` prefix and `user-invocable: false` and `metadata.type: governance` are set |
| Improve an existing governance | the named target file already exists | the existing file is read first and only the gaps or issues found are changed |
| Verify quality before handing back | a freshly written or edited governance | the quality checks are run and any CRITICAL or HIGH failure is fixed before the file is presented |
| Report and point to the next step | a completed governance | the canonical path, runtime symlinks, content type, and check outcome are reported and the user is pointed at `start-mission` to spec and eval it |
