description: Agent Config Examination & Specification — spec-driven evaluation for skills, AGENTS.md sections, subagent definitions, and commands.

**ACES** (Agent Config Examination & Specification) is a plugin that applies spec-driven evaluation to [agent configuration](/concepts/agent-configuration/) — the skills, `AGENTS.md` sections, subagent definitions, and commands that shape how AI agents behave.

## The problem

Agent configuration has the same failure modes as prompts, but none of the safety nets:

- **Silent regression** — editing a skill's `description:` changes when the agent invokes it, with no signal that something broke.
- **Trigger mismatch** — vague trigger language causes the agent to fire too broadly or too narrowly.
- **Ambiguous rules** — inconsistent behavior that only surfaces in real sessions, after the damage is done.

Code has a type-checker, a linter, and a test suite. Agent configuration has none of those built in. ACES fills that gap.

## How it works

ACES applies [spec-driven development](/sdd/overview/) to the agent configuration layer:

1. Register ACES with [`init-aces`](/aces/init-aces/), then author or improve the artifact itself with [`define-skill`](/aces/define-skill/), [`define-agent`](/aces/define-agent/), or [`define-governance`](/aces/define-governance/).
2. Build a **golden set** of labeled test cases for the artifact via `sdd:start-mission` — the SDD conductor resolves ACES's spec-producer (`aces-scenario-writer`) to author the `.feature` and the impl-producer to author `eval.md` + `golden-set/`.
3. **Score** the current artifact against each case using an LLM judge on a 1–5 rubric, via [`run`](/aces/run/).
4. **Compare** scores before and after an edit with [`compare`](/aces/compare/) — block commits on regression.
5. **Improve** the artifact by diagnosing failing cases and applying targeted edits with [`improve`](/aces/improve/).

### Evaluation layers

Evaluation runs in four independent layers:

| Layer | What it checks |
|---|---|
| **Structural** | Required fields and format (via `cyber-skills audit`) |
| **Trigger** | Does the agent invoke this artifact at the right times? |
| **Behavior** | When invoked, does the agent follow the steps and rules? |
| **Quality** | Is the output the agent produces actually good? |

Each eval suite opts in to the layers relevant to its artifact type. A simple `AGENTS.md` section may skip trigger evaluation; a skill always needs trigger and behavior.

## Skills

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`init-aces`](/aces/init-aces/) | Register ACES as the SDD plugin for agent-configuration domains |
| [`define-skill`](/aces/define-skill/) | Create or improve a workflow skill (`SKILL.md`) |
| [`define-agent`](/aces/define-agent/) | Create or improve an agent definition (subagent, persona, or dual-mode) |
| [`define-governance`](/aces/define-governance/) | Create or improve a reference-only governance file |
| [`run`](/aces/run/) | Score the golden set against the current artifact |
| [`add-scenario`](/aces/add-scenario/) | Add a test case from a real failure or edge case |
| [`compare`](/aces/compare/) | Diff scores before/after an edit — regression gate |
| [`improve`](/aces/improve/) | Diagnose failing cases; propose and apply targeted edits |
| [`report`](/aces/report/) | Project-wide health dashboard across all eval suites |

## Typical workflow

```
init-aces (once)
     ↓
define-skill / define-agent / define-governance → sdd:start-mission (spec + eval suite)
                                                          ↓
                                                         run → compare → improve → run
                                                          ↑                  ↑
                                                    add (new cases)   report (project view)
```

Run `init-aces` once per project to register the plugin. Author or improve the artifact with `define-skill`, `define-agent`, or `define-governance`, then use `sdd:start-mission` to author its `.feature` and eval suite. Run `run` to get a baseline. Edit the artifact, then use `compare` before committing. When cases fail, `improve` diagnoses the pattern and proposes edits.

## Eval suite structure

```
artifacts/specs/<suite-name>/
  eval.md               # target, judge model, threshold, enabled layers
  golden-set/
    001-<slug>.md       # one test case per file
    002-<slug>.md
  results/
    <ISO8601>.json      # run output: pass rate, mean score, per-case results
```

Suites live in `artifacts/specs/` alongside SDD specs. Each suite has its own pass threshold — different artifacts warrant different bars.

## Health classification

`report` classifies each suite:

| Status | Condition |
|---|---|
| `healthy` | Pass rate ≥ 90% |
| `degraded` | Pass rate 70–89% |
| `critical` | Pass rate < 70% |
| `trending-down` | Pass rate dropped ≥ 10% vs. previous run |
| `no-data` | No results yet |

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add cyberuni/cyber-skills --plugin aces
```
