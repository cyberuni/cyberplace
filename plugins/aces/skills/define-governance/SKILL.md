# Define Governance

Create or improve a governance file — a reference-only skill that encodes criteria,
standards, or workflow rules. Governance files are loaded on demand by other skills
or agents; they never auto-trigger from user input.

## Governance vs. skill

| | Governance | Workflow skill |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Criteria, standards, rules the agent enforces | Steps the agent executes |
| **Triggered by** | Explicit load (`/<name>` or `## References`) | User situation matching `description:` |
| **Auto-trigger** | Never | Yes, when description matches |
| **Body style** | Normative rules, checklists, rubrics | Numbered steps, decision logic |

If the content describes *what to enforce* (a rubric, a quality bar, a constraint set),
it is a governance file. If it describes *how to do something* (a workflow), it is a
workflow skill.

## Determine placement

If the target scope is not clear from context, ask:

> Where should this governance file live?
> 1. **User-global** (`~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) — available across all projects
> 2. **Project** (`.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) — scoped to this repo
> 3. **Inside a plugin** (`plugins/<plugin-name>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) — distributed with the plugin

After the user selects, derive the canonical path.

## Gather requirements

Ask the user:

1. **Name** — kebab-case slug (e.g. `commit-discipline`, `skill-design`, `review-rubric`)
2. **Topic** — one sentence: what domain does this governance cover?
3. **Consumers** — which skills or agents will load this? (informs the structure and depth)
4. **Content type** — select the primary content shape:
   - **Rubric** — scored criteria (1–5 or pass/fail) for evaluation
   - **Constraint set** — rules that must not be violated
   - **Checklist** — ordered or unordered items to verify
   - **Decision table** — conditions → outcomes
   - **Mixed** — more than one of the above
5. **Rules or criteria** — the actual content; collect from the user or from an existing document

If improving an existing file, read it first. Ask only about gaps or issues found.

## Draft the governance file

Write the file at the canonical path using this structure:

```markdown
---
name: <name>
description: "Internal skill: <one sentence — what domain this governs and who loads it>"
user-invocable: false
metadata:
  type: governance
---

# <Title>

Apply when: <one-line scope — the situation or artifact type this governs>

## <Section per content type>

<Normative rules, rubric rows, checklist items, or decision rows>

## References

<on-demand standards, sibling files, external HTTPS URLs — no repo file paths>
```

Rules for the body:
- Use `description: "Internal skill: …"` prefix — suppresses auto-triggering in all harnesses
- Set `user-invocable: false` — future harnesses use this field; current harnesses fall back to the prefix
- Do not include `## Why`, `## Rationale`, or causal prose — put that in ADRs
- Encode decisions and criteria, not facts the model already knows
- Keep each rule atomic and independently falsifiable

## Create symlinks

Governance files follow the same symlink convention as skills. After writing the canonical
file, create symlinks for each runtime the user targets:

| Runtime | Symlink target |
|---------|---------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` → canonical path |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc` → canonical path |

Use relative paths from the symlink location.

## Run quality checks

After writing, evaluate the governance file against these checks:

| # | Check | Severity |
|---|-------|----------|
| G1 | `description` starts with `"Internal skill:"` | CRITICAL |
| G2 | `user-invocable: false` present | HIGH |
| G3 | `metadata.type: governance` present | HIGH |
| G4 | No `## Why` or `## Rationale` section | HIGH |
| G5 | Body opens with `Apply when:` scope line | MEDIUM |
| G6 | All rules are atomic and independently falsifiable | MEDIUM |
| G7 | No workflow steps (numbered action sequences) | MEDIUM |
| G8 | `name` is kebab-case and matches file stem | HIGH |

Report results. Fix any CRITICAL or HIGH failures before presenting the final file.

## Report

Summarize:

- Canonical file path
- Runtime symlinks created
- Content type(s) encoded
- Quality check outcome
- Suggested next step: run `sdd:create-spec` (the operator resolves the ACES roles) to spec and eval for this governance file
