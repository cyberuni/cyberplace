# Define Skill

Create or improve a **workflow skill** — a process, tool-based, or standard SKILL.md — then hand it
to the ACES eval loop to spec and score.

When the conductor dispatches this skill as a generic builder (`produced-by sdd:automaton`) for the
ACES **impl-producer** role (implement mode, against a frozen `.feature`), it co-produces **two**
artifacts: the SKILL.md **and its verification** — the scenario→rubric eval suite (`eval.md` +
`golden-set/`, one eval per frozen scenario) that the impl-judge (`aces-implementer`) will run. As
impl-producer it self-aligns to `sdd:ownership-governance` plus the resolved **builder-impl +
architect-impl** bars (the ACES builder-impl is `aces:aces-builder-impl`). The judge never authors
evals, so write any missing eval here. (Invoked standalone — no frozen `.feature` — only the SKILL.md
is produced.)

## Route the request first

`define-skill` owns **workflow skills**. Defer when the intent belongs to a sibling that carries the
same config vocabulary:

| The request is really about… | Defer to |
|---|---|
| a named reusable **agent** / delegated worker / an in-context **persona** | `define-agent` |
| a **reference-only rule set / governance** other skills load but never execute as steps | `define-governance` |
| generalizing **the current session's** work into a skill | `skillify` |
| **scoring** an existing config, or **adding** an eval case | `run` / `add` |
| **diagnosing** why an existing skill's evals fail | `improve` |

A persona request that surfaces mid-authoring is handed to `define-agent` — do not scaffold a persona
skill here.

## Load the governance

Before writing content, load the **skill-design** governance and read stdout as the authoritative
rules for principles, progressive disclosure, description structure, and when to extract deterministic
logic to a script:

```bash
npx cyber-skills@<version> governance show skill-design   # resolve <version> via: npm view cyber-skills version — never @latest
```

If the skill will ship a `scripts/` directory or document CLI commands agents run, also load
**agent-tool-output** for stdout / JSON / non-interactive / stderr rules.

## Settle the shape — five questions

Answer all five before writing a line of SKILL.md. If any cannot be inferred from what the user has
said, **ask the user to resolve it** — never invent it:

| Question | What to decide |
|---|---|
| Scope | What exactly does this skill do? One workflow only. |
| Trigger condition | When should it fire? List both explicit and implicit phrasings. |
| Output contract | What artifact does it produce — a file path, a report format, a decision? |
| Quality bar | How will you know a run succeeded? A concrete pass condition. |
| Out of scope | What must this skill explicitly NOT do? |

## Choose the pattern

Capture the workflow shape (separate from placement). A persona is **not** a pattern here — route it
to `define-agent`.

| Pattern | When to use it | Body shape |
|---|---|---|
| Process | Ordered multi-step workflow with decision points | Numbered steps |
| Tool-based | Consistent use of tools, systems, or connectors | Tool usage + guardrails |
| Standard | Tone, format, structure, or quality enforcement | Rules + pass conditions |

## Resolve placement and runtimes

Pick placement before scaffolding; if unclear from context, ask:

| Placement | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| User-global | `~/.agents/skills/<name>/` | Personal, across all projects; no README |
| Project-private | `.agents/skills/<name>/` | Contributor tooling; add `metadata: internal: true` |
| Project-public | `skills/<name>/` (or `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<name>/`) | Shipped with a package; **requires a README** |

Check whether `npx skills` is available, then scaffold at the derived path:

```bash
npx skills --version 2>/dev/null && npx skills init <name> --dir <placement-dir>   # else: mkdir -p <placement-dir>/<name>
```

Ask which runtimes to target; the SKILL.md is the canonical file, each runtime location is a symlink
to it. Create and **verify** one symlink per selected runtime:

| Runtime | Symlink location |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/<name>` (or `.claude/skills/<name>`) |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/skills/<name>` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/skills/<name>` |

```bash
ln -sf <relative-path-to-canonical> <runtime-location> && ls <runtime-location>   # verify it resolves
```

## Draft the SKILL.md

Write the file at the canonical path:

```markdown
---
name: <name>          # kebab-case, must match the directory name exactly
description: <capability> + "Use when <trigger>" + an implicit-phrasing example ("even if they say …")
---

# <Title>

## When to use
<the trigger condition, restated for the body>

## Instructions
1. <step>
2. <step>
```

- **Description** — the only field loaded at startup; it carries the whole triggering burden. Target
  150–400 characters (≤1024 hard limit): capability + "Use when…" + an implicit phrasing. For a
  **sub-skill** other skills call (not user-triggered), prefix the description with `"Internal skill:"`
  so it does not self-activate.
- **Body** — step-by-step, under 500 lines. Keep the *when* here; move any **deterministic,
  fixed-output** step to a `scripts/` file or an existing CLI and have the body only say when to run
  it.
- **Project-public** skills get a `README.md` beside the SKILL.md (title, when-to-use, what-it-does,
  install line). User-global skills get none.

### Improving an existing skill

If the target SKILL.md already exists, **read it first** and change **only** the gaps or issues found
— leave every sound part intact. This fills gaps in a skill's *definition*; diagnosing failing evals
is `improve`.

## Audit before handing back

Run the structural audit and fix any CRITICAL or HIGH finding **before** presenting the skill:

```bash
npx cyber-skills@<version> audit validate --path <placement-dir>/<name>
```

For a fuller pass, invoke the `improve-skill` / `audit-skill` skills. Do not present a skill with an
open CRITICAL finding.

## Report and hand off to the ACES eval loop

Summarize:

- Canonical SKILL.md path
- README path (project-public only)
- Runtime symlinks created and verified
- Audit outcome

Then point the user at the **ACES eval loop** to spec and score the skill — run `sdd:start-mission`
(the conductor resolves the ACES roles for the `skill` artifact-type) to author its `.feature` and
eval suite, or `add` / `run` to grow and score a golden set. Do **not** embed a legacy
trigger-query eval file as the test step — scoring is the ACES loop's job.
