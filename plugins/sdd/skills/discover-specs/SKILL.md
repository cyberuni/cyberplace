# Discover Specs

The concrete engine for SDD **spec discovery**. It locates the
project specs in a repo and returns each one's frontmatter — **without reading any spec body** — so a
consumer (the **gateway**, corpus tooling) can route on `status` / `project-path` / `approval`
cheaply. It carries a self-contained `.mts` script (the repo's node-≥23.6 / no-deps convention).

## Recognition — location-bounded and shape-confirmed

A `spec.md` is a spec only when **both** hold (ADR-0017, narrowed; extra anchors per ADR-0019 —
`sdd:lifecycle-governance`):

- **Location** — it sits at one of the three fixed SDD spec locations, **or** at an extra anchor the
  project declared in `.agents/sdd/spec-anchors.toml`:
  1. `.agents/spec/spec.md` — repo-root single-project
  2. `.agents/specs/<project>/spec.md` — repo-root multi-project
  3. `<project-path>/.agents/spec/spec.md` — a nested project (the `**` is the project-path, any depth)
  4. **extra anchors** — each config entry, a repo-relative pattern (`*` globs one segment, `**`
     globs zero or more segments at any depth, `<project>` globs and captures a name); **opt-in and
     additive** (absent config ⇒ only 1–3, so today's behavior is unchanged). Curated via the
     `manage-spec-anchors` skill.
- **Shape** — its frontmatter `status` is in the lifecycle enum (`draft | approved | implemented |
  deprecated`). A `spec.md` at any recognized location with **no** lifecycle `status` is skipped (so
  the scan never grabs a stray file by accident); a status-bearing `spec.md` at neither a fixed
  convention nor a declared extra anchor is not discovered. An **unreadable or malformed**
  `spec-anchors.toml` is ignored (warn + fall back to the fixed conventions), so the scan never
  crashes on a corrupt config.

## Run the scan

```bash
node "<skill>/scripts/discover-specs.mts" [--root .] [--format toon|json] [--resolve <name>]
```

- Default `--root` is the current directory; default `--format` is **TOON** (the token-efficient
  tabular form the gateway scans).
- Emits one row per spec, sorted by folder slug, with columns
  `path,name,nameSource,status,projectPath,approvals` — `path` is the spec's root-relative folder
  slug; `name` is the project name and `nameSource` is `declared | derived | guessed` (below);
  `approvals` is the gate verdicts as `<gate>:<verdict>` pairs joined by `;`.
- `--resolve <name>` filters to the **exact (case-insensitive) name matches** — 0 rows = none,
  1 = resolved, >1 = ambiguous (the consumer disambiguates with the user).
- `--format json` emits the same records as a flat JSON array for non-LLM consumers.

Example (TOON):

```
specs[2]{path,name,nameSource,status,projectPath,approvals}:
  .agents/specs/aced,aced,derived,implemented,plugins/aced,spec:approve;impl:approve
  .agents/specs/sdd,sdd,derived,approved,plugins/sdd,spec:approve
```

**`name-source`** flags how trustworthy the name is: **`declared`** (frontmatter `name`,
authoritative), **`derived`** (repo-root single-project → `repo`; a `.agents/specs/<project>` folder
names itself), **`guessed`** (a nested project's folder basename — confirm with the user before
relying on it).

When `node` is absent, an agent performs the same derivation by hand: scan the three spec locations,
keep each `spec.md` whose frontmatter `status` is in the enum, read its frontmatter only, and derive
the name per the rules above.

## Boundaries

Frontmatter only — the script reads the whole file but its **output** carries no body content, so a
consuming agent never spends tokens on a body (`digest` reads bodies; this never does). It owns no
lifecycle state and writes nothing. The script resolves a name **deterministically** (exact match →
spec, or the candidate set); **disambiguating with the user** is the consumer's agentic step, not the
script's.
