# SDD — Spec-Driven Development

Keep your project's **spec and behavior suite** alive next to the code, and let an agent
carry each change through one autonomous loop — from intent, to a frozen contract, to a
verified result — while you decide *what to build* and the agent decides *how far it may go
on its own*.

SDD ships as a plugin for your AI coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex). Install it,
say `use SDD`, and describe a change. The plugin grills your request into spec + suite
deltas, builds against them, and lands the result in your delivery shape.

## Why SDD

Most "spec-driven" setups treat the spec as a throwaway design doc that rots after the
first commit. SDD treats the spec and its behavior suite as **durable, maintained layers**
of your project — abstractions of the code that humans actually read to know what the
project *is* and does.

- **One project, one spec.** No fleet of per-feature specs to re-approve on every
  cross-cutting change. Size is handled by organizing into folders, never by splitting into
  sibling specs.
- **The agent stays on a leash you set.** Every change passes an autonomy rubric that
  self-clears the safe, routine work and escalates only what genuinely needs you. You aren't
  a checkpoint on every transition.
- **Nothing slips past the contract.** Behavior is pinned to checkable `.feature`
  scenarios. At the spec gate they **freeze**; the implementation is verified against the
  frozen suite before it can ship.

## The mental model

SDD maintains four layers, each an abstraction of the one below. Every layer stays real and
maintained — a drifted spec is a defect, the same as a bug in code.

```
change-request (CR)   ← the intent you grill into spec + suite deltas
  spec + behavior suite  ← what the project is and does; what humans read
    code                   ← what engineers, security, and agents analyze
      outcome                ← what actually happens
```

Change enters at the **top** as a change-request and flows **down**: a CR names a delta to
the spec + suite, authoring realizes it there, the mission drives it into code, and the
outcome follows. You never edit the outcome directly — you edit the abstraction that
produces it.

## How a change moves through SDD — the Mission Loop

One cycle carries one change-request to completion, on one working tree:

1. **intake** — a change enters from a prompt, GitHub, Asana, Jira, Linear, or a local
   store. Nothing enters the system except as a CR.
2. **explore** — *build to learn.* The agent grills your CR into a concrete spec + suite
   diff, spikes to discover what the contract needs, and shows you intermediate results to
   steer it. This phase ends at the **spec gate**, where the touched `.feature` files
   **freeze**.
3. **deliver** — *build to keep.* The agent builds against the frozen suite, then a cold
   judge verifies the implementation against it at the **impl gate**.
4. **handoff** — land the verified result in the shape your project declares: commits to
   `main`, a branch + PR, or written prose.

After a cycle completes, four **outer loops** may fire and emit *new* change-requests —
nothing re-enters in place:

- **campaign** — what the project should *be*: grow and prune capabilities.
- **formation** — is the corpus organized right: dedupe, split, reconcile.
- **doctrine** — how we work: distill strategy from the trail, retire stale plans.
- **forge** — improve SDD itself from opt-in field corrections.

## Autonomy you control — gates and the leash

There is **no mandatory approval station**. Every write to the spec or suite passes one
arbiter: a self-clear-vs-escalate rubric. Routine, additive, low-blast work self-clears
(provisionally, recorded for you to ratify later); the rest escalates to you.

You set how far the agent may run with a **leash**:

| Leash | The agent self-asserts | It stops at |
|---|---|---|
| `auto-none` | nothing | the spec gate |
| `auto-spec` | the spec gate | the impl gate |
| `auto-all`  | both gates | nothing |

A self-cleared verdict is always **provisional** — it lands in a review queue for you to
ratify, never stealing accountability. Leaning autonomous is safe because everything SDD
writes is git-reversible.

The only hard stops that always require you are the **four C's**: **Clearance** (a change
that narrows or deletes an existing guarantee), **Conflict resolution** (the suite
contradicts itself), **Compatibility** (a change-class above your authorized ceiling), and
**Consent** (opt-in data egress in the forge loop). The first, third, and fourth can be
pre-authorized up front so they never halt you mid-flight.

## Freeze — the contract baseline

When a `.feature` is approved at the spec gate, it **freezes** — it becomes the settled
contract the implementation must satisfy. Freezing is per file, not per project.

- **Adding** a scenario widens the contract and self-clears — it folds in without
  unfreezing.
- **Narrowing or rewriting** a scenario unfreezes its file and goes back through the spec
  gate (and trips the Clearance floor).
- `spec.md` prose stays aligned but is **never frozen** — you're free to reword and
  restructure it as long as it doesn't contradict a frozen scenario.

A request to change a frozen scenario is never edited in place; it re-enters as a new CR.

## Harness requirement — two-level spawning

SDD's operator runs as a spawned agent that **itself spawns cold judges**, so the loop needs
a harness that supports subagent nesting **at least two levels deep** (session → operator →
judge). SDD targets only harnesses that clear this bar: **Claude Code** (up to 5 levels) and
**Cursor** (two). **Codex** ships flat (one level) and must have `agents.max_depth` raised to
at least `2`; harnesses that forbid nesting outright (e.g. Gemini CLI, Amp) cannot run the
cold-judge model and are not supported. Deeper chains than two levels are not assumed — SDD is
designed to fit within a two-level budget.

## Getting started

1. **Install the plugin** through your agent's marketplace.
2. **Initialize the workspace** so mission plans have a home (`.agents/plans/`, tracked with
   your code; on Cursor it's symlinked to `.cursor/plans`).
3. **Invoke it.** Say `use SDD`, `use Spec-Driven Development`, or `$sdd`, then describe the
   change you want. The gateway classifies your request, routes it into a mission, and runs
   the loop — pausing only when the rubric escalates to you.

Your spec lives at `<repo>/.agents/specs/<project>/` (or `.agents/spec/` for a
single-project repo) — **outside** any distributable plugin directory, so it never ships to
your consumers.

## Extending SDD to new artifact types

SDD knows how to produce and judge specs for many kinds of artifacts — npm packages, agent
skills, agent definitions, React components, docs, and more. A **domain plugin** teaches it
a new one by filling five production-chain roles (spec-producer, solution-producer,
spec-judge, impl-producer, impl-judge) and registering itself into your project's
`.agents/universal-plugin.json`. Any role it leaves open falls back to a sensible SDD
default. Producers run inline with the operator; judges always spawn cold, so a grader
never shares the author's context.

This repo ships example domain plugins — **ACES** (agent-configuration domains) and
**Quill** (documentation domains) — that plug into SDD this way.
