# place-node

Internal SDD skill — the concrete engine for the **place-node** step. Given a new node's `concept`
(and optional name), suggests a **provisional** capability home (derived from where that concept
already lives) and catches possible duplicates, so explore places a node in one lookup.

```bash
node scripts/place-node.mts --spec-dir <corpus> --concept resolution --name leash
```

Read-only and advisory; placement is finalized at handoff. See [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) for the full
contract. Not user-invocable.
