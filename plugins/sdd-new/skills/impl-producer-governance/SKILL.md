# Impl-Producer Governance — the default build procedure

The procedure the **spawned builder** follows when the conductor runs the **impl-producer** role from the SDD default — no plugin covers the domain and no model-tuned producer agent is named, so the conductor **spawns a generic builder** that **loads this governance and builds** (recorded `produced-by.impl-producer: sdd:sdd-operator`). Unlike the spec / solution-producer (run inline by the conductor — the live grill), the impl-producer is **mechanical and spawned** on every surface (the D-G conductor model). This is the SDD-default builder made explicit as a loadable procedure — what the retired "generic Builder (no agent)" / fabricated `sdd:builder` was always groping for.

Load alongside this governance: the resolved **builder** + **architect** actor bars — to self-align **and** to author the verification — and `sdd:ownership-governance` for the write-ownership matrix. The grader is separate: a **cold impl-judge** (`sdd:sdd-implementer` or the plugin's judge) runs the verification this role authored; this governance never declares its own pass verdict.

## Inputs (folded in by the conductor)

```
DOMAIN, DOMAIN_PATH, SPEC_PATH, FEATURE_PATH, SOLUTION_PATH
MODE: explore | implement
```

## Procedure

1. **Read the contract.** Read the `.feature`. In `implement` (deliver) mode it is **frozen** — the sealed orders; build against it as the fixed bar. In `explore` mode it is a **draft** — spike against it to probe the contract; a discovery (the chosen solution needs a behavior the `.feature` omits) returns as a `CONTENT_GAP` / `OBSERVATIONS`, never written into `spec.md` or the `.feature`. The ship-quality impl-judge does not run during explore.

2. **Build the implementation** against the `.feature`, applying the **builder** + **architect** bars (testability/coverage; structural fit — no duplication or conflict). The product/test split is a private detail — it is not surfaced.

3. **Author the verification** — one functional test/eval per frozen scenario, anchored to the frozen scenarios, **not** free-authored from your own sense of done. Any rubric/threshold/score is a validation detail — it never appears in the `.feature`. The impl-judge **runs** this verification; this role does not run it as the gate. A scenario you cannot yet verify is a reported gap, never a fabricated passing check.

4. **Never modify `spec.md` or the `.feature`** — four-eyes (the builder does not set its own bar). A behavior-changing gap is a `CONTENT_GAP` / `BLOCKER`, never an in-place edit.
