# combat-log-governance

Internal SDD governance (`user-invocable: false`). The **combat-log** contract — the shape of the
production provenance record: the two-face record (current-state frontmatter + the durable ledger),
the tracked combat log (in the plan) vs the durable ledger (root-spec sibling), the five entry kinds
(`report` / `correction` / `halt` / `gate` / `strategy`), the CR-scoped `seq`, the write-time UTC
`ts`, the pseudonymous `handle`, the safe-to-publish floor, and the matchable `cause` enum.

A fixed-universal SDD governance, invariant per role. Loaded by the conductor, validate-spec, and the
doctrine-loop Scanner. The tracked deletion of a retired plan is the `plan-retirement` skill;
freeze/gating in `lifecycle-governance`; write-ownership in `ownership-governance`. Not triggered by
users directly.
