# cyberfleet — the fleet layer over cyberlegion

> Root project spec — the **descriptive** top index for the `cyberfleet` **CLI** (the npm package
> at `packages/cyberfleet`). This project is a thin **fleet layer** built on top of the
> `cyberlegion` mechanism package. It carries only the fleet-specific verbs; the agent-behavior half
> — the `fleet` persona gateway and the `crew` personas — lives in the sibling `cyberfleet-plugin`
> project (`../../.agents/specs/cyberfleet-plugin`, source `plugins/cyberfleet`).

## What this is

The `cyberfleet` CLI turns the metaphor-free `cyberlegion` mechanism (spawn a session, carry mail,
identify peers) into a **fleet** view: ships, missions, and the Council. It **depends up** on
`cyberlegion` — the harness-agnostic, MCP-free primitive that owns session lifecycle, the file
mailbox, identity/registry, and hook surfacing. cyberfleet adds nothing to that mechanism; it wraps
it in the fleet's own operations.

**Ship** and **command-center** are cyberfleet's own concepts, keyed on cyberfleet's own project-local
marker `.agents/cyberfleet/` (written by `cyberfleet init`) — never inferred from cyberlegion's
private `.agents/cyberlegion/` marker. A directory carrying the marker is a ship (git primary,
worktree, or non-git folder alike); a directory without it is the command-center. **Fleet** (a group
of ships) is a deferred concept — undefined until a command-center operation needs to act on one.

The dependency is **by intent** (ADR-0021): cyberfleet imports `cyberlegion` as a workspace library
for its own verbs, and a fleet persona runs the mechanism verbs against the `cyberlegion` CLI
directly (`cyberlegion unit register`, `cyberlegion mail send`, `cyberlegion unit spawn`, …).
cyberfleet does **not** re-expose those mechanism verbs — that duplication is exactly what the
extraction removed.

## What cyberfleet owns (fleet verbs)

Only the verbs with genuine fleet logic live here — everything else is `cyberlegion`'s:

| Verb | What |
|---|---|
| `cyberfleet init` | commission a ship — write cyberfleet's own opt-in marker `.agents/cyberfleet/ship.json`; idempotent. See [`init/`](./init/README.md) |
| `cyberfleet mode` | report **ship** (any directory carrying the `.agents/cyberfleet/` marker — git primary, worktree, or non-git folder) vs **command-center** (off-ship), and the shared fleet root. Keyed on cyberfleet's own marker, never `.agents/cyberlegion/`. See [`mode/`](./mode/README.md) |
| `cyberfleet missions` | the Council view — ships × mission × gate × leash, **derived from SDD state** (the one place cyberfleet reads SDD) |
| `cyberfleet jump <peer>` | select/focus a ship's session (tmux pane), or print its worktree path to `cd` into |
| `cyberfleet pause <peer>` | flip a ship record to `status: paused` — a marker only (**not** a bridge to SDD's `pause-mission` checkpoint; that gap is flagged, never papered over) |
| `cyberfleet gate approve` | **stubbed** — a human ratification cannot be safely relayed through this CLI (the relayed-ratification seam); it prints what it would write and exits non-zero |

## Where the mechanism went

The identity / messaging / session-spawn / decommission / surfacing behaviors were **extracted into
`cyberlegion`** (`packages/cyberlegion/.agents/spec/` — nodes `identity`/`mail`/`session`/
`surfacing`, plus `dispatch`/`wake`/`agent`). Those are the canonical, frozen behavioral scenarios
now; cyberfleet no longer owns or re-describes them.

## Placement map

Where a new concept lives — slot here, do not invent placement:

- **a new ship-commissioning operation** (writing/reading cyberfleet's own `.agents/cyberfleet/`
  opt-in marker) → the `init` surface (create) / `mode` surface (read).
- **a new fleet-status / mode operation** (ship vs command-center, the shared root) → the `mode`
  surface. Ship/command-center is keyed on cyberfleet's **own** `.agents/cyberfleet/` marker, never
  cyberlegion's `.agents/cyberlegion/`.
- **a new Council/mission-view operation** (joining ships to SDD mission/gate/leash state) → the
  `missions` surface — the only place cyberfleet reads SDD.
- **a new ship-navigation operation** (focus a pane, resolve a worktree path) → the `jump` surface.
- **a new mechanism operation** (unit, mail, unit spawn/close, surfacing, dispatch, wake)
  → **not here** — that is `cyberlegion` (`packages/cyberlegion`). cyberfleet depends up on it.
- **a new persona / mode-switch / crew behavior** (when to spawn, message etiquette, recruit or tune
  a crew) → **not here** — that is the `cyberfleet-plugin` project (`plugins/cyberfleet`).
- **a fleet-level operation over a group of ships** (act on a particular fleet from the
  command-center) → **deferred** — the **fleet** grouping (which ships form a fleet) is not defined
  until the first such verb needs it. `mode` reports only ship-vs-command-center, never a fleet.

## Behavioral nodes

| Node | What |
|---|---|
| [`init/`](./init/README.md) | commission a ship — write `.agents/cyberfleet/ship.json` (opt-in marker), idempotent |
| [`mode/`](./mode/README.md) | ship vs command-center, keyed on cyberfleet's own `.agents/cyberfleet/` marker |

## Backfill gap (known)

`init` and `mode` are captured as behavioral nodes above (`cyberfleet-mode-init`). The remaining
fleet verbs — `missions` / `jump` / `pause` / `gate approve` — are **implemented** (in `src/cli.ts`,
`src/missions.ts`, with smoke coverage in `src/cli.test.ts`) but **not yet captured as behavioral
nodes**. Backfilling them (with `.feature` suites) is a future change request; `pause` and
`gate approve` carry open design questions (dissolve-vs-bridge, the relayed-ratification seam) to
settle at that time.
