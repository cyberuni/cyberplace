# surfacing — inject unread mail into a session across harnesses

`mail hook --event SessionStart|PostToolUse` emits the harness hook payload that injects a spawned
unit's brief and its unread mail into a session, and `admin install` wires that hook into a
project's harness config. Migrated from cyberfleet's `surfacing` node in `legion-extract-core`
(CR-2).

## Use Cases

**Subject** — surfacing a peer's pending brief and unread mail into its own next turn via the
harness's own hook mechanism, and wiring that hook up in the first place:

- **mail hook emits the harness injection payload for unread mail (and a first-run brief)** —
  `mail hook --event <SessionStart|PostToolUse>` resolves the calling agent's own identity, then:
  - on the agent's first hook call while its status is still `spawning`, reads its brief file and
    includes it (`## Your brief`) in the injected context, then flips its status to `active` so later
    calls never re-inject the brief;
  - includes every currently-unread message (`## Unread mail (<N>)`) with sender, subject, body, and
    id;
  - emits the combined payload as the harness's `hookSpecificOutput` shape (raw JSON on stdout, not
    TOON — this command is consumed by the harness, not a human) whenever there is a brief and/or
    unread mail to inject.
- **The dedicated hook command is used, not a generic exec** — the injection payload is produced only
  by `mail hook`; no other CLI path emits `hookSpecificOutput`.
- **An unregistered caller injects nothing rather than erroring** — when the calling session has no
  resolvable self id, `mail hook` prints nothing and exits 0; it never fails the harness turn.
- **No unread mail and no pending brief injects nothing** — a registered, active caller with an empty
  inbox and no brief pending produces no stdout output at all, still exit 0.
- **An unsupported --event is rejected** — only `SessionStart` and `PostToolUse` are recognized;
  anything else throws naming the two supported values.
- **install wires the hook per harness, idempotently, event-scoped by vendor support** — `admin
  install --agent <harness> --dir <path>` registers `cyberlegion mail hook --event <event>` into that
  harness's own hook config file (`.claude/settings.json`, `.cursor/hooks.json`,
  `.codex/hooks.json`). `SessionStart` is wired for every harness (claude, cursor, codex);
  `PostToolUse` is wired only where the harness supports it (claude and codex — cursor has no
  PostToolUse hook). Running install again for the same harness does not duplicate the entry
  (`already present` rather than a second registration).
- **Owner mail surfaces into a root session, never into a spawned unit** — beyond the caller's own
  brief and unread mail, `mail hook` also surfaces the **standing owner** inbox's unread mail (bodies
  included) under a distinct owner-mail heading, so a human at any top-level session sees a frameless
  agent's report inline without pulling it manually. The gate is **"is this a spawned unit?"**, not
  "is this the human" (the human roams and can't be identified): a caller whose record has a
  `spawnedBy` (a legion-spawned unit) surfaces **no** owner mail; a top-level session with no
  `spawnedBy` surfaces it. Surfacing **never acks** — an unread owner message re-surfaces on every
  hook call until it is explicitly acked (`mail ack --owner`), and once acked it no longer surfaces.
  Showing a message in a session's context is a model printing text, not proof a human read it, so
  read stays a deliberate act. When no standing owner record exists at all, `mail hook` surfaces no
  owner section and still exits 0 (it never fails the harness turn). The `spawnedBy` gate suppresses
  legion-spawned units but not a *top-level* autonomous session (a frameless cron agent also has no
  `spawnedBy`) — such a session is still a root context, so surfacing there is accepted for now; a
  headless opt-out is a CR-B / formation follow-up, not this node's concern.

**Non-goals** — the mail primitives themselves (send/inbox/read/ack, `mail/`), the doorbell nudge
(`session/`), thread correlation and the bounded `mail await`/`watch` (`wake/`) — this node only
covers the hook payload and its installation.

Every scenario in [`surfacing.feature`](./surfacing.feature) maps to one of these behaviors:

| Behavior | What it covers |
|---|---|
| **hook emits brief + unread mail** | first-run brief inject + status flip; unread mail listing every call |
| **dedicated hook command** | the injection payload is produced only by `mail hook` |
| **unregistered caller injects nothing** | no self id → nothing printed, exit 0 |
| **no unread + no brief injects nothing** | empty payload → nothing printed |
| **unsupported --event rejected** | only SessionStart/PostToolUse accepted |
| **install wires per-harness, idempotently** | SessionStart for all three; PostToolUse only where supported; re-run does not duplicate |
| **owner mail surfaces into root sessions only** | root (no `spawnedBy`) surfaces standing-owner unread with bodies under an owner heading; spawned units don't; never acks; acked no longer surfaces |
