      floor: none — 4 additive scenarios on the frozen `unit/lifecycle/lifecycle.feature` for `unit spawn` delivering the peer's first turn (gherkin-cli addOnly:true, 4 added / 0 modified / 0 removed); stays `@frozen`, no re-open.
      blast: low — first-turn ring on the existing spawn behavioral node; `README.md` synced (Use-Case bullet + 3 scenario-map rows + Non-goals note for the out-of-scope warm-pool / `--visible` axes).
      novelty: low — spawn now completes turn-delivery (a best-effort first-turn doorbell over the boot-race submit-verify path) on top of payload-delivery (the brief file); mirrors `mail/doorbell`'s best-effort ring atop the fail-loud `nudge` primitive; `--no-wake` opts out. Mechanism, not routing — dumb-hands charter intact.
      confidence: high — cold sdd-spec-judge ALIGNED true (oracle/builder/architect all PASS); no open markers; coverage complete (happy ring, boot-race re-submit, best-effort warning, `--no-wake`).
      judge: cold sdd-spec-judge — oracle/builder/architect all PASS; ALIGNED true.

# cyberlegion — the CLI: harness-agnostic agent spawn and messaging

> Root project spec — the **descriptive** top index for the `cyberlegion` **CLI** (the npm package at
> `packages/cyberlegion`). Behaviors live in the capability folders below.

`cyberlegion` is the metaphor-free foundation both SDD and the `cyberfleet` fleet-persona layer depend
**up** on: it spawns and reaps agent sessions and carries durable inter-agent mail. A caller delegates
work and awaits a verdict by composing those primitives — spawn a peer and await its **mail**, or run
a cold subagent and take its **Task result** — not through any CLI result-slot. It carries **no** fleet
metaphor and **no** SDD knowledge.

The CLI is **pure mechanism** — dumb hands a caller (the Legate routing brain, in the `cyberlegion`
plugin) composes. It never selects a backend and never invokes a harness subagent tool; routing
(warm-peer vs cold-subagent vs run-inline) is the caller's judgment.

State lives in a global hub at `~/.agents/cyberlegion/` (identity + mail data, addressable
across project and worktree boundaries) plus a project-local `<project>/.agents/cyberlegion/` (tracked
marker only). A spawned unit's own git worktree checks out as a **sibling** of the primary checkout
(`<parent>/<repo>.worktrees/legion-<id6>`), never nested inside the primary's own tree. All
mailbox + registry access goes through a domain `Store` interface (a `FileStore` impl today).

## Capabilities

| Node | Concern |
|---|---|
| [`mux/`](./mux/README.md) | the unit-agnostic pane abstraction — backend selection, placement, multiplexer detection |
| [`unit/`](./unit/registry/README.md) | the instance registry (`unit/registry`) + warm session lifecycle (`unit/lifecycle`) |
| [`mail/`](./mail/README.md) | durable inter-agent messaging — plain send/inbox/read/ack/delete (`mail/core`), thread correlation and bounded await/watch (`mail/wait`), hook injection and owner-mail surfacing / the pull side (`mail/surface`), waking the recipient on delivery / the push-side doorbell (`mail/doorbell`) |
| [`agent/`](./agent/README.md) | resolve reusable agent definitions |
| [`attach/`](./attach/README.md) | the human's read-pane — an attention pointer to the hub's main pane |
| [`init/`](./init/README.md) | the onboarding front door — auto-detect the harness and register the surfacing hook (owns the per-harness installer) |
| [`admin/`](./admin/README.md) | hub-state maintenance (`admin migrate`) |

> CR-2 (`cyberlegion-cli-realign`, ADR-0024) realigned this tree to command groups + one node per
> real architectural layer (`mux`); `identity`/`session` dissolved into `unit`, `surfacing`/`wake`
> dissolved into `mail`/`mux`/`init`, `attach`/`admin` are new. **CR-4 dissolved `dispatch/`
> entirely**: the result-slot (`prep`/`collect`/`Store.result`) is dropped — a caller composes
> `unit spawn` + `mail await` (channel) or a cold Task subagent that returns via Task-result — and the
> routing brain (warm-peer vs subagent vs run-inline) lives in the Legate plugin, not the CLI. See
> `.agents/plans/cyberlegion-cli-realign.migration-map.md` for the full scenario→target contract.
