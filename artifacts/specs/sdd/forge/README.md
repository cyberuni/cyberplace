# forge/ — the field outer loop (SDD self-improvement)

The **Forge loop** — the step-5 outer loop that improves **SDD itself** from real field
usage. It is the **external** outer loop: where campaign/formation/doctrine retrospect on a
project's *own* combat logs (internal), forge reaches *outside the installation* and asks the
**end-users of an installation** to **opt in and share field corrections**, so the shared SDD
contract grows from real corrections rather than invented ones. Owned by the **maintainers**.

There is **no `harness/` folder**: a project's engineering harness (toolchain, CI,
distribution) is the project's own concern, outside SDD, and has **no dedicated loop**. Forge
does not evolve it.

## Internal vs external — what makes forge different

| Loop(s) | Source | Improves |
|---|---|---|
| campaign / formation / doctrine | the project's own combat logs (**internal**) | the project |
| **forge** | **end-user corrections across installations (external, opt-in)** | **SDD itself** |

Because forge moves data *out of an installation*, it carries the **Consent** hard floor (one
of the three C's; see `../design/autonomy-rubric.md`).

## Output — emits new CRs

Findings re-enter the system as **new CRs** through the single intake (`../intake/README.md`);
the loop never auto-applies anything. The trigger is retrospective: a recurring correction
pattern in the field. The maintainers' **Council** holds keep-or-cut; nothing becomes work
without a ratified CR.

## The cross-installation field unit

The unit fed upstream is the combat-log **`correction`-with-`cause`** record — the same
provenance unit `../design/provenance-model.md` owns; this folder consumes that shape, it does
not redefine it. Because corrections can carry code, prompts, paths, and secrets, **opt-in,
redaction, visibility, and human review are load-bearing, not bolted-on**:

| Stage | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Consent** | explicit opt-in; **default OFF**; revocable. With opt-in OFF the loop captures nothing and sends nothing — fully inert. |
| **Minimize** | capture only the correction-with-cause record needed upstream — not surrounding context, not the whole transcript. |
| **Redact / anonymize** | strip or mask sensitive content (secrets, paths, identifying data) before anything can be transmitted. |
| **Preview** | the user reviews **exactly what would be sent** before it leaves — no opaque payload. |
| **Maintainer review** | a submission enters the shared corpus **only** after a human maintainer reviews it. |

**Hard invariant:** sensitive data is never transmitted unredacted; a record that has not
passed redaction is never eligible to leave the environment.

## Optional and downstream — never blocking

The field loop is **entirely optional**. SDD's core workflow — intake, explore, deliver,
handoff, and the other outer loops — runs **identically whether the field loop is present,
absent, or opted out**. It is **never a dependency** of any core step. `priority: 3` — built
after the core loops are solid, costing nothing operationally in its absence.

## Boundaries — Forge owns the field channel only

A product decision → `../campaign/`; a corpus-structure observation → `../formation/`; a
process lesson → `../doctrine/`. Forge owns only the **opt-in, cross-installation channel**
that improves SDD from real field corrections — nothing about a project's own harness.

## Scenarios

Unit scenarios (consent OFF ⇒ nothing captured; no unredacted transmit; core workflow
unaffected) colocate in this folder; cross-capability outcome scenarios live in `../acceptance/`.
