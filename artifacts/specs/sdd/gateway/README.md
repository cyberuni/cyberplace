# gateway/ — the universal router/door (the `sdd` skill)

The front door to the project, and the clearest case of **not part of any loop** — it is
**not** part of the Mission Loop. The gateway does two things: **classify** — activate SDD,
gather missing intent, classify the request — and **route**, where its routing table **is**
the user-skill→capability index (there is no separate skills file). It routes a request to a
**mission** (via `../intake/`), to a `../corpus/` tool, or to an **outer-loop operation**. It
is a **thin relay**: it holds no production logic, it only classifies, relays the Council's
answers down, and carries escalations up. It does not edit project files, register hooks,
install packages, or require a CLI.

## Intake

Treat `$sdd`, "use SDD", and "use Spec-Driven Development" as explicit activation. Every
request that activates the gateway is a CR (see `../intake/README.md`); classification
decides which source carried it and which capability handles it.

- **Fast path.** When the invocation already names enough to act — an artifact and an
  action, or a self-evidently classifiable request — skip the menu and route directly.
- **Gather missing intent.** When the request is bare, do not guess; conduct intake to
  recover the missing piece (the work, or the action), then classify.
- **Surface pending strategy.** When the Council re-enters, surface the count of pending
  (unratified) `strategy` lines across the specs' sibling `combat-log.jsonl` ledgers — the
  doctrine loop's keep-or-cut — as an entry point. The gateway only *surfaces* the count:
  it never drafts strategy (the Scanner's job) nor ratifies it (the Council's positional
  act). A zero count is not surfaced.
- **Never ask more than four options (hard rule).** A single `AskUserQuestion` carries at
  most four options — the intake tool rejects more than four (`too_big, maximum 4`). When a
  derived list would exceed four, present only the most-actionable few (≤ 4) or ask the
  user to name the target directly; never enumerate into an over-four question and never
  truncate silently.

## The routing table is the user-skill→capability index

Classification routes a request to the **capability** that handles it. The capabilities are
the SDD project's screaming-architecture folders — so the routing table doubles as the
index of what a user can invoke. No separate `skills.md` is needed.

| User intent | Capability (handler) |
|---|---|
| Raise / record a change | **intake** — open a CR through a source (`../intake/README.md`) |
| Grill a CR into spec + suite deltas; review the diff at the spec gate | **authoring** (owns the spec gate) |
| Implement + verify against the acceptance suite | **mission** (owns the impl gate; the autonomous orchestrator) |
| Land the verified result in the project's delivery shape | **mission/handoff** |
| Dedupe, split, reconcile, or inspect the corpus | **corpus** |
| Zoom into one inner-loop agent (live) | **inject** (`../intake/README.md`) |
| Durably tune an inner-loop agent | **project** (`../intake/README.md`) |
| Representation / meta-work with no freezable behavior | **escape** — recorded, proceeds outside the lifecycle |
| Product / structure / process / harness retrospective | the **campaign / formation / doctrine / forge** loop — emits a new CR |

The structural axis (`project` vs `feature`) is **derived from graph edges**, not declared
at intake, so routing classifies *what a user wants to do to the project*, not *which spec
in a fleet*.

## Hand the work to the Operator

When the route is resolved, the gateway **spawns the Operator** (`sdd-operator`) once for
the segment to carry out the downstream work. The Operator is the only agent this gateway
spawns; the authoring, validation, and mission stations are stations the Operator runs
in-session, never agent types the gateway spawns.

### The relay carries the user channel

The Operator has **no user channel** — it lives at the relay ↔ Operator boundary, and this
gateway *is* the relay:

1. Spawn the Operator for the segment.
2. When the Operator returns `STATUS: needs-input` with batched `QUESTIONS`, ask the
   Council those questions.
3. Resume the Operator by re-spawning it with the Council's answers.
4. Repeat across segments until `STATUS: complete` or `blocked`.

The Operator escalates to the Council **only at gates** (a go/no-go verdict to advance
status) and at **scrub** (a kill decision); outside those it runs autonomously to the next
checkpoint. The Operator never asks the Council directly — every escalation is carried by
this relay.

### Write-ownership is preserved

The relay model changes *who is invoked how*, not *who writes what*. The gate station owns
the `status` write and the human ratification of `approval`. The Operator owns `aligned`
and any provisional self-assertion. The relay writes neither.

## Recognize the escape and the freeze

- **Escape.** When intake classifies the unit of work as representation / meta-work with no
  freezable subject behavior, route to **escape**: state explicitly that the work is
  leaving the lifecycle, create no draft, invoke neither gate. Ambiguity defaults *into*
  the lifecycle (see `../intake/README.md`).
- **Freeze.** SDD freezes the `.feature` at approval. A request to change a frozen scenario
  is not edited in place; it re-enters as a CR that grills the spec back open through
  `authoring/` before scenarios may be revised.

## Scenarios (colocated)

```gherkin
Scenario: explicit invocation activates the gateway
  Given the user invokes $sdd
  When the gateway handles the invocation
  Then SDD is activated for the current work

Scenario: a bare invocation gathers intent before routing
  Given the user invokes $sdd with no work item, artifact, or action
  When the gateway conducts intake
  Then it does not begin work until the route is known

Scenario: a fully specified request takes the fast path
  Given an invocation that names both the work and the action
  When the gateway classifies it
  Then it routes directly to the handling capability without a menu

Scenario: an intake question never exceeds four options
  Given a derived list of more than four candidates
  When the gateway asks the user
  Then it presents at most four options and never truncates silently

Scenario: pending strategy is surfaced on re-entry
  Given unratified strategy lines exist across the combat-log ledgers
  When the Council re-enters through the gateway
  Then the gateway surfaces the count of pending strategy as an entry point
  And it neither drafts nor ratifies any strategy

Scenario: a resolved route hands off to the Operator
  Given the gateway resolves a route
  When it carries out the downstream work
  Then it spawns the Operator and spawns no other agent

Scenario: the relay carries an Operator escalation to the Council
  Given the Operator returns needs-input with batched questions
  When the gateway receives them
  Then it asks the Council and resumes the Operator with the answers

Scenario: an unroutable request invokes no SDD action
  Given a nonempty request that names no handling capability
  When the gateway classifies it
  Then it reports the request as unroutable and invokes no SDD action

Scenario: a frozen feature is not edited in place
  Given an approved spec whose .feature is frozen
  When the user asks to change a scenario
  Then the gateway routes the change back through authoring rather than editing the frozen feature
