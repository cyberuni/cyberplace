# Provenance model

The **shape** of production provenance. Provenance spans **three tiers** by lifetime (below):
a **tracked per-worktree plan** (transient in the tree, durable in git history), a durable
**ledger**, and a durable **public** trail. The
durable record has **two faces** — a current-state face in `spec.md` frontmatter and the
append-only `ledger.jsonl` sibling. This file owns the record shape, the entry
shapes, the matchable `cause` enum, and write-ownership.
Recording *behavior* (when the operator appends, how it resolves a producer) lives in
`../mission/`; this is the shape only.

## Three provenance tiers

Provenance splits by **lifetime and audience** (rationale + the cross-harness survey:
ADR-0015). Mid-flight working detail is per-mission and committed with the work, then
removed from the tree at retro (durable in git history); the durable record is sparse and
outlives the CR.

| Tier | Home | Holds | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Private scratch — the plan** | `.agents/plans/<cr-ref>.plan.md` (brief) + `.agents/plans/<cr-ref>.log.jsonl` (**the combat log**) | grill analysis + task DAG + progress; the append-only `report` / `correction` lines + a **CR-scoped `seq`** | **transient in the tree, durable in history** — tracked, distilled then deleted at retro |
| **Durable internal — the ledger** | `ledger.jsonl` sibling to the **root** `spec.md` | only `gate` (verdict + `frozen[]`) and `strategy` (incl. the distilled recurrence) | durable |
| **Durable public — the trail** | the CR source conclusion + changesets + git history | what shipped, for the outer loops to read forward | durable, external |

**Naming (fleet metaphor).** The mid-flight `*.log.jsonl` is the **combat log** — the
blow-by-blow of the mission while it is fought. The durable `ledger.jsonl` is the **ledger** —
the sparse book the doctrine loop **distills** the combat log into and keeps. "Combat log"
always means the live per-mission log in the plan; "ledger" always means the durable sibling
of the root `spec.md`. They are never the same file.

The plan is also a **portable handoff artifact**: a self-contained Markdown brief, co-located
with the worktree (not a home-dir session), readable by any agent or model that picks up the
mission. `<cr-ref>` is the source-qualified CR id (`github-34`, `asana-<gid>`, `local-<slug>`).
The `.agents/plans/` tree is **tracked** (committed with the work, kept in the PR — the
`report`/`correction` trail is the decision + failure history reviewers want). Concurrent
missions never collide on it because each plan is keyed by `<cr-ref>` (source-qualified) and
a CR is claimed by exactly one worktree at a time (the source-claim lock,
`../intake/README.md`) — **not** because of gitignore. `.agents/plans` is the real,
tool-agnostic home; for Cursor interop the SDD `init` skill symlinks
`.cursor/plans → .agents/plans` so a plan written by either tool is seen by both (setup +
migration: `../plugin/README.md`). The two faces below describe the **durable** record; the
chatty mid-flight lines live in the plan.

## Two faces, two homes

| Face | Home | Shape | Mutability | Holds |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Current-state** | `spec.md` frontmatter | `produced-by` (map by role) + `approval` (map by gate: `verdict` + `why`) | **overwritten** — last write wins | the authoritative *present*: who produced each artifact, and the **standing** verdict per gate (the latest CR's outcome) |
| **Ledger** | sibling `ledger.jsonl` | one JSON object per line, appended in order | **immutable** — lines appended, never edited or removed | the durable *history*: every CR's `gate` verdict + `strategy`, in order (mid-flight detail lives in the plan) |

The current-state face answers *"who produced this, and what is the verdict now?"* The
ledger answers *"what was decided to get here?"* They do not duplicate: a gate rejection
overwrites nothing in `approval` (the eventual `approve` stands there), but the rejection is
preserved forever as a `gate` line (`verdict: reject`) in the ledger. This is the
load-bearing reason the ledger exists — current-state alone loses every superseded verdict.
(The mid-flight `correction` that drove a rejection lives in the tracked plan — transient in
the tree, durable in history — not here.)

**`approval` is standing, not historical.** The project has **one durable spec** that many
CRs flow through; `spec.md` `approval` holds only the **latest** CR's gate verdict
(overwritten each time), answering *"is the contract cleared right now, and who last
ratified?"* The **durable per-CR record** — *"CR #34's diff was approved by X, why Y"* —
lives in the ledger as a `gate` line (below), keyed by `cr`. The same two-face split that
separates `produced-by` (standing) from `report` (historical) separates `approval`
(standing) from `gate` (historical). There is **no per-CR `approval` block** in
frontmatter and no separate per-CR sidecar file.

**Every ledger line carries an optional `cr`.** Because one `ledger.jsonl` now spans
many change requests against the one durable spec, each entry tags the CR it belongs to
(`"cr": 34`) so a reader groups a mission's lines without the transcript. Outer-loop
`strategy` lines (cross-CR by nature) may omit it.

**The ledger is operational provenance, not contract.** `ledger.jsonl` is **never
frozen and never gated**: it keeps appending across the whole lifecycle, including while
`spec.md` and the `.feature` are frozen at `approved`. The freeze and the gates govern the
contract (`spec.md` + the `.feature`) only.

Write flow: the operator dispatch **overwrites** the current-state face in `spec.md`,
**appends** mid-flight `report` / `correction` lines to the **combat log** (the plan's
`*.log.jsonl`), and **appends** self-asserted `gate` lines to the durable `ledger.jsonl`. At
retro the doctrine-loop Scanner reads the concluded combat log, **distills** recurring causes,
and **appends** `strategy` lines to the ledger. **Deletion is decoupled from distill** (Plan
retirement, below): the distill fires at `→ implemented`; the **tracked deletion** of the
plan is a separate, later retro step, gated on source = `done`/merged **and** distilled.

## Current-state face — `produced-by` (+ `approval`)

`produced-by` records **which producer made each spec artifact**, in frontmatter,
**always** — not only when two plugins contend. Together with `approval` (the judging
twin) it gives full per-artifact provenance: who **produced** it and who **judged** it.

| Field | Records | Keyed by | Written by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `produced-by` | who **made** each artifact | production role (`spec-producer`, `plan-producer`, `impl-producer`) | operator, at dispatch |
| `approval` | who **judged** each gate (`verdict` + `by` + `why`) | gate (`spec`, `impl`) | operator (self-assert) / skill (ratify) |

Each `produced-by` value is the **plugin-qualified agent name** (`aces:aces-scenario-writer`,
`quill:quill-doc-writer`, or `sdd:sdd-operator` when SDD's own inline default produced it —
see `specialists-and-squads.md`). Recorded **always**, on every production. It plays two deliberately separated roles:

- a **historical record** — immutable provenance ("`X` produced this `.feature`"), the
  data ACES needs to measure result quality and trace a bad artifact to its producer;
- a **resume cache** — on a later run the operator reuses the recorded producer if its
  plugin is still installed, so resume is decisive without re-asking.

```yaml
status: approved
produced-by:
  spec-producer: aces:aces-scenario-writer
  plan-producer: sdd:sdd-operator
  impl-producer: sdd:sdd-operator
approval:
  spec:
    verdict: approve
    by: unional
```

**Provenance is historical; resolution is live.** "`X` produced this" stays true forever,
even after `X` is uninstalled — never rewrite or erase it on the basis of current
availability; annotate `[unavailable]` rather than drop it. The registry
(`.agents/universal-plugin.json`) is the source of truth for **who acts next**;
`produced-by` is a **cache**, never an authority.

**`domain-plugin` stays distinct from `produced-by`.** `domain-plugin` is the
forward-input disambiguation choice for an ambiguous artifact-type (which plugin to
resolve); `produced-by` is the after-the-fact record of who actually produced each
artifact. The conflation of the two was the original `sdd-plugin` impl-gate blocker; they
are not the same field.

### Availability degrades; structural validity fails closed

The "never blocks" invariant is scoped to **availability**:

- **Availability** — a recorded producer whose plugin is **gone** is still valid history:
  it is **flagged** (`[unavailable]`), not blocked; live resolution re-resolves a new
  producer for the new production.
- **Structural validity** — fails **closed**: a **malformed** `produced-by` entry (not a
  well-formed plugin-qualified name) is not valid provenance and **blocks**; a role with
  **no resolvable producer** (not even an SDD default) **blocks**; an off-enum or absent
  `cause` (below) **blocks**. The consistent rule: **availability degrades gracefully
  (flag-not-block); structural validity fails closed (block)**.

## Entry shapes — across the plan and the ledger

One JSON object per line (JSON Lines). Every line carries a **CR-scoped `seq`** (append order
*within its CR*, restarting per CR — never a global counter) and a `kind`. Four kinds, split
by tier: **`report`** and **`correction`** are mid-flight → the **combat log** (the plan's
`*.log.jsonl`); **`gate`** and **`strategy`** are durable → the slim `ledger.jsonl`.

A CR-scoped `seq` is collision-free under concurrency: one CR lives in exactly one worktree at
a time (the source-claim lock, `../intake/README.md`), so two concurrent missions always hold
different CRs and never mint the same `(cr, seq)`. The durable ledger receives only sparse
`gate`/`strategy` lines, so its rare cross-tree appends reconcile by **union merge** (keep all
lines — they are independent records, never contradictions); set `ledger.jsonl merge=union`
in `.gitattributes`. This append reconciliation is purely mechanical and **never** reaches the
hard floor (which is for semantic frozen-scenario conflicts, not log appends).

**Free-text hygiene (committed-plan rule).** Because the combat log is **committed** (the plan
is tracked), the free-text `summary` / `detail` fields describe the **decision or its class**
only — they **never embed code, prompts, secrets, or literal values** (those stay in the
uncommitted raw `.jsonl` transcripts, read only for token-waste). The structured fields are
enums (`role` / `agent` / `outcome` / `correction-kind` / `cause`); the free text stays
commit-message-grade. Enforced by `combat-log-governance`; no redaction pipeline is needed.

### `report` — per-subagent dispatch (plan, tracked)

One line appended **to the plan** per production-chain dispatch, so a later reader (or a
handed-off agent) reconstructs what each delegate did without the transcript. Removed with
the plan at retro (a tracked deletion).

```jsonl
{"seq": 3, "kind": "report", "role": "spec-producer", "agent": "sdd:sdd-operator", "outcome": "pass", "summary": "wrote 14 scenarios covering the ledger expansion"}
```

`role` is the production role dispatched; `agent` is the plugin-qualified agent name;
`outcome` is `pass | fail`.

### `correction` — correction-with-cause (plan, tracked)

The hard requirement. One line **in the plan** per correction: a gate rejection, a
producer⇄judge iteration, or a Council kick-back. The matchable `cause` is the
**load-bearing field**. Raw `correction` lines are transient in the tree (committed, then
removed with the plan at retro); at
retro the **doctrine loop** reads them and folds recurring `cause`s into the durable
`strategy` line's running count (`../doctrine/README.md`). Cross-mission recurrence is
therefore tracked by the *distilled* count, not by scanning many specs' raw logs.

```jsonl
{"seq": 7, "kind": "correction", "correction-kind": "gate-reject", "cause": "coverage-gap", "detail": "spec gate rejected — no negative scenario for the malformed-entry path"}
```

- **`correction-kind`** — the closed set `gate-reject | judge-iteration | council-kickback`.
  This names the *occasion* of a correction, not its cause; do not conflate the two.
- **`cause`** — a **minimal, discovered enum**. The matchable category of *why* a
  correction happened, not free text. Three are grounded so far:

  | Cause | Means | Grounded in |
  |---|---|---|
  | `coverage-gap` | a use case or operation lacked a covering scenario | a gate rejection for a missing scenario was observed |
  | `design-overreach` | the design added a mechanism the architecture did not need (e.g. an unnecessary sentinel / path) | a Council rejection of a design that introduced a superfluous sentinel |
  | `spec-feature-contradiction` | the `spec.md` body and the `.feature` asserted contradictory behavior | a judge-iteration where the spec narrative and a scenario disagreed (sdd-warden) |

  **Growth principle.** The enum is **closed at any point in time** but **discovered from
  usage, not designed up front**: a new value is **added** only when a real, recurring
  correction has no existing category. Fewer is better — speculative categories are not
  seeded. Two growers: the **doctrine-loop Scanner's** recurring-pattern detection, and the
  opt-in **Forge loop** (`sdd-forge-loop`) collecting real corrections from plugin usage.

  **Who edits the enum.** A grower *proposes* a value; **adding it is an edit to
  `combat-log-governance`, ratified by the Council** (a producer/judge/operator never edits
  the enum on its own). Until ratified, an off-enum `cause` still fails closed.

  A `cause` value that is **absent or off-enum** is a **structural error** (it breaks
  cross-mission matchability), not valid provenance, and **fails closed**.

### `gate` — the durable per-CR gate verdict

The durable record of *"this CR's diff was approved (or paused/rejected) at this gate."* One
line per gate verdict per CR — the immutable twin of the standing `approval` block in
`spec.md` frontmatter. Where `approval` is overwritten by the next CR, the `gate` line
preserves every CR's verdict forever, keyed by `cr`.

```jsonl
{"seq": 9, "kind": "gate", "cr": 34, "gate": "spec", "verdict": "approve", "by": "unional", "cause": "dimension", "frozen": ["intake/intake.feature", "mission/mission.feature"]}
```

- **`gate`** — `spec | impl`, the gate this verdict closes.
- **`verdict`** — `approve | pause | reject`, mirroring the `approval` enum.
- **`by`** — the ratifier: a human name (ratified) or `agent` (self-asserted, provisional).
  A self-assertion additionally carries the four-dimension `why` derivation, same as
  the frontmatter block; a human ratification needs none.
- **`cause`** — `dimension | ceiling`: what drove the verdict (a gradient dimension, or the
  human ceiling cap), mirroring the `approval` entry's `cause` (`lifecycle-model.md`). This
  is the **stop cause** — distinct from a `correction` line's matchable `cause` enum.
- **`frozen`** — the suite files this verdict **froze** (spec-gate `approve` only): the
  per-file freeze record. Freeze is a per-file `@frozen` tag on each `.feature` (see
  `lifecycle-model.md`); this list records *which* files the CR froze, so the ledger answers
  *"what was frozen as of CR #34"* standalone — no git walk. This is a **local** durable
  record (the gate's, per G); it is **not** what the Forge loop reads — Forge consumes the
  distilled `correction`-with-`cause`, not `frozen[]` (`../forge/README.md`).

The `gate` line is the **load-bearing answer to G**: with no per-folder `status`/`approval`,
the durable "CR approved + scenarios frozen" record is this ledger entry, not a sidecar and
not a growing frontmatter block.

### `strategy` — the slot this contract shapes but does not write (ledger, durable)

The Scanner records drafted strategy to the durable ledger. This contract defines the
**shape** of that line; the **write is owned by the doctrine-loop Scanner**, not by any
provenance writer. The `strategy` line also carries the **distilled recurrence count** for a
`cause` (in `evidence`), maintained across missions because the raw `correction` lines that
fed it are removed with each plan at retro.

```jsonl
{"seq": 12, "kind": "strategy", "recommendation": "codify the coverage-gap pattern as a spec-governance check", "evidence": ["coverage-gap x3 across sdd-foo, sdd-bar, sdd-baz"], "ratified": false}
```

`evidence` lists the corrections that drove the recommendation; `ratified: false` means
the Council holds keep-or-cut — unratified strategy never enters the corpus.

## The detail-adjustment report — a view of the plan

During implement-and-verify, the operator serves expansion and minor fixes in-flight (not
the human), recorded in a **detail-adjustment report** — a *view of the plan's `report` and
`correction` lines*, not a separate journal. The human enters only on the hard floor
(`autonomy-rubric.md`). Live current-state is regenerated on demand; the durable record is
the ledger.

## Write ownership

The mid-flight `report` / `correction` lines are appended to the **plan** (`*.log.jsonl`);
the durable `gate` / `strategy` lines are appended to the **ledger** (`ledger.jsonl`).
No writer touches the ledger through `spec.md` frontmatter. Both are append-only: lines are
added with the next CR-scoped `seq`, never edited or deleted.

| Writer | May append | To | Never writes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **operator** | `report`, `correction` | the **plan** | strategy lines; human-ratified `gate` lines |
| **operator** | **self-asserted `gate`** (`by: agent`, same boundary as `produced-by` / `aligned` / a self-asserted `approval`) | the **ledger** | human-ratified `gate` lines |
| **gate skill (`validate-spec`), in-session** | **human-ratified `gate`** (`by: <name>`) | the **ledger** | report / correction / strategy lines |
| **doctrine-loop Scanner** | `strategy` (incl. distilled recurrence) | the **ledger** | report / correction / gate lines |
| **producers / judges** | nothing | — | the entire record — they do not know their own registry identity authoritatively |

A human-ratified `gate` line follows the **positional authority** rule
(`lifecycle-model.md`): only the in-session position holding the real user channel writes
`by: <name>`; a spawned operator writes only `by: agent` self-assertions and emits a verdict
packet on a human gate.

## Readers split by path

| Reader | Reads | Never reads |
|---|---|---|
| `sdd` gateway (status scan) | `spec.md` frontmatter — `status` field only | the ledger or the plan |
| doctrine-loop Scanner | the concluded **plan** (`*.log.jsonl`, at retro) + the durable ledger | `spec.md` frontmatter |

The gateway performs a **status-only scan**. The Scanner reads the concluded plan to distill
recurrence and drafts `strategy` into the durable ledger; the plan itself is deleted later (a
tracked deletion, gated — see Plan retirement). Forge reads
the distilled `correction`-with-`cause` from the ledger; campaign / formation read the durable
**public** trail (CR source + changesets + git), **not** the plan (`../campaign/README.md`,
`../formation/README.md`).

## Spec-folder shape

| File | Role | Frozen? | Gated? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spec.md` | contract prose + standing current-state frontmatter | **never** (kept aligned) | yes |
| `<name>.feature` | contract scenarios | **per file**, via its own `@frozen` tag, set on a spec-gate `approve` that touched it (see `lifecycle-model.md`) | yes |
| `ledger.jsonl` (root sibling) | durable ledger — `gate` + `strategy` only (append-only, `merge=union`) | **never** | **never** |

The mid-flight **plan** (`.agents/plans/<cr-ref>.plan.md` + `.log.jsonl`) is **not** part of
the spec folder: it is **tracked** per-worktree scratch (committed with the work, kept in the
PR), removed from the tree at retro once distilled and its source is done/merged (ADR-0015).

Freeze is **per suite file**, not a single project-wide baseline: each `.feature` carries
its own `@frozen` tag. The standing `approval` in `spec.md` says the contract was last
cleared; the set of `@frozen` files says *which* scenarios are currently the frozen
contract; the `gate` ledger lines say *which CR* froze each.

## Plan retirement — distill early, delete late

The committed plan is **retired** in two decoupled acts, both owned by the **doctrine loop**:

- **Distill (early).** At `→ implemented` (before the PR exists), the Scanner reads the
  concluded combat log and distills recurring `cause`s into the ledger's `strategy` lines.
- **Delete (late).** The plan files (`<cr-ref>.plan.md` + `<cr-ref>.log.jsonl`) are removed
  from the tree as a **tracked deletion** — git history preserves them — only when **both**
  hold: the source is `done`/merged **and** the plan has been distilled. Never delete an
  un-distilled plan (the retro never ran). Deletion runs as doctrine's **last retro step**,
  after the distill writes to the ledger. The act is idempotent: a missing plan or an open
  CR is a no-op, so the retirement sweep is safe to re-run.

The provenance gain over the old gitignore model: history shows exactly **when** a plan was
distilled and dropped, and reviewers keep the decision + failure trail in the PR.
